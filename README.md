# PearSimulation
Simulation and benchmarking framework for 2D/3D, numerical, ODE, PDE, fluids and other experiments.

In summary, a general software toolkit for my own "research" work.

## Status
This software framework is still in active development and will be developed through my studies at the University of Heidelberg.
It is just a personal project and does not represent the University of Heidelberg in any way.

## What is this repository for?
This repository contains the whole source code and the used resources.
Parts without licenses are excluded.

## How do I get set up?
You need the QT SDK and qmake to compile the code. Just use the PearSimulation.pro as the project file and everything should be fine.
```Shell
qmake PearSimulation.pro
make
```

## Contribution guidelines
Just fork and let me see your features. I'm happy for every kind of support, but read the LICENSE file for more copyright information.
