# PearSimulation
Simulation framework for numerical, ODE, PDE and other experiments.

## Status
This software framework is still in active development and will be developed through my studies at the University of Heidelberg.
It is just a personal project and do not represent the University of Heidelberg in any way.

## What is this repository for?
This repository contains the whole source code and the resources for the complete framework.

## How do I get set up?
You need the QT SDK and qmake to compile the code. Just use the PearSimulation.pro as the project file and everything should be fine.

## Contribution guidelines
Just fork and let me see your features. I'm happy for every kind of support, but read the LICENSE file for more copyright information.
